# Tasks

The `tasks` here are designed to be consumed via remote task includes in a single root level `tasks.yaml` in the downstream repo. Includes should follow the standard remote include pattern documented by UDS CLI:

```yaml
includes:
  - deploy: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/defenseunicorns/uds-common/$TAG/tasks/deploy.yaml
```

Pinning to a specific tag of a task (rather than `main`) with renovate watching for updates is **strongly recommended** since tasks do rely on dependencies like command syntax for `zarf` and `uds` as well as the published versions of `uds-core`.

## Supported Tool Versions

- UDS CLI: 0.25.0
- UDS Core: 0.38.0
- K3D: 5.8.3
- Lula: 0.16.0

> [!NOTE]
> Zarf is not required for tasks in this repo, the vendored zarf (`uds zarf`) included with UDS CLI is used instead to prevent version mismatches.

## Task Files

There are multiple task files available in this repository with different objectives and required variables.

<!-- TODO: @WSTARR - these were generated with Maru off of https://github.com/defenseunicorns/maru-runner/pull/151 - once that feature is finalized a workflow should be added to check this file for missing text -->

This task file defines a set of linting commands to ensure code quality and compliance. It includes tasks to install linting tool dependencies, perform checks on YAML files and OSCAL configurations, validate shell scripts with shellcheck, and verify or add the SPDX license identifier in source files. Both the `license` and `fix-license` tasks parse a `.license_config.yaml` file in the project root directory, but will default to the Defense Unicorns dual-license if the file is not present.

#### Example `.license_config.yaml`

```yaml
license: AGPL-3.0-or-later OR LicenseRef-Defense-Unicorns-Commercial
copyright: Defense Unicorns
ignore: [] # an array of paths to ignore
