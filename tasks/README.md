# Tasks

The `tasks` here are designed to be consumed via remote task includes in a single root level `tasks.yaml` in the downstream repo. Includes should follow the standard remote include pattern documented by UDS CLI:

```yaml
includes:
  - deploy: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/defenseunicorns/uds-common/$TAG/tasks/deploy.yaml
```

Pinning to a specific tag of a task (rather than `main`) with renovate watching for updates is **strongly recommended** since tasks do rely on dependencies like command syntax for `zarf` and `uds` as well as the published versions of `uds-core`.

## Supported Tool Versions

- UDS CLI: 0.18.0
- UDS Core: 0.29.1
- K3D: 5.7.4
- Lula: 0.9.1

> [!NOTE]
> Zarf is not required for tasks in this repo, the vendored zarf (`uds zarf`) included with UDS CLI is used instead to prevent version mismatches.

## Task Files

There are multiple task files available in this repository with different objectives and required variables.

<!-- TODO: @WSTARR - these were generated with Maru off of https://github.com/defenseunicorns/maru-runner/pull/151 - once that feature is finalized a workflow should be added to check this file for missing text -->
