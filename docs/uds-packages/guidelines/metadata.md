# Application Metadata

When a uds-package [achieves a badge](../requirements/uds-package-requirements.md), it is eligible for inclusion and publishing on the Airgap App Store [apps.uds.is](https://apps.uds.is). _(soon apps.defenseunicorns.com [#170](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/uds-marketplace/issues/170))_

Packages listed on the App Store include some metadata describing the package. [zarf-dev/zarf#2976](https://github.com/zarf-dev/zarf/issues/2976) introduces annotations, which will be leveraged to provide this metadata. Until released, the metadata will be stored in a separate file in the App Store repository.

Instructions on creating Application Metadata can be found in [uds-appstore Contributing Guide](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/uds-appstore/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#app-store-package-metadata)
