# Application Metadata

When a uds-package [meets the requirements](../requirements/uds-package-requirements.md), it is eligible for inclusion and publishing on the [UDS Registry](https://registry.defenseunicorns.com/).

Packages listed on the Registry include some metadata describing the package. [zarf-dev/zarf#2976](https://github.com/zarf-dev/zarf/issues/2976) introduces annotations, which will be leveraged to provide this metadata.

Instruction on metadata will be included in the uds packages [Template README](https://github.com/uds-packages/template/blob/main/README.md)
