# UDS Marketplace Package Integration Guide

## Introduction

This guide is intended for developers integrating applications with UDS (Unicorn Delivery Service). It provides an overview of the integration process, key considerations, and resources to ensure a smooth integration. If you are familiar with UDS Package creation, [Badging Requirements](./requirements/uds-package-requirements.md) may be more relevant.

Integrating a Package fundamentally means:
1. Creating a repository `uds-package-<name>` from [uds-package-template](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/uds-package-template)
2. Integrating the upstream helm chart as a zarf package `zarf.yaml` to build a declarative OCI artifact
3. Adding a UDS package Custom Resource `uds-package.yaml` to integrate with UDS Core via Pepr
4. Build a 'zero CVE' package by replacing images with a `*-unicorn` flavored image

## Prerequisites

- UDS generally assumes applications are containerized and can be deployed via Kubernetes. (exceptions are possible, but rare, and require additional work e.g. KubeVirt)
- The integrator (you) should have access to the application image and deployment code.
- The "App" should have a compatible license for UDS integration (Apache 2.0 or similar) [see Licensing Considerations](#licensing-considerations).

### Licensing Considerations

- Defense Unicorns creates Apache 2.0 licensed products exclusively, see the [Open Source Policy](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/uds-common/blob/main/docs/adrs/0002-apache-2.0-for-all-uds-products.md).
- Vendors in the marketplace will carry forward their license and associated fees.
- When in doubt, ask in the #product-support channel in Slack. Legal and Business considerations are being evaluated.


## Getting Started

Before beginning the integration process, familiarize yourself with the following resources:

1. [UDS Capabilities Documentation](https://uds.defenseunicorns.com/capabilities/): Provides information about UDS, UDS CLI, UDS Core, and UDS Bundles.
2. [Zarf Documentation](https://docs.zarf.dev): Zarf is a tool for declarative creation & distribution of software packages.
3. [UDS Common Repository](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/uds-common): Contains information and best practices for UDS integration.
4. [UDS Applications Tracker](https://coda.io/d/Product_dGmk3eNjmm8/Applications_suCbOWqL#_lu8fEKSc): Lists many backlogged and completed applications for UDS integration.
5. Briefly review [Pepr Documentation](https://docs.pepr.dev/): it may become useful when you begin integrating with UDS Core.

## Integration Checklist

When integrating an application with UDS, consider the following requirements and suggestions:

### Step 1 - Zarf Package

Your goal is to bundle the upstream helm chart and images into a single Zarf package, defined in a `zarf.yaml`

*reminder https://docs.zarf.dev*

- [ ] Understand Zarf's [Helm Chart component primitive](https://docs.zarf.dev/ref/components/#helm-charts)
- [ ] The Command `uds zarf dev generate` may be useful to generate an initial `zarf.yaml` file for your application.
- [ ] Identify the application's images, the command `uds zarf dev find-images` may be useful.
- [ ] The application may require additional configurations at build time or runtime, consider [Zarf Component Actions](https://docs.zarf.dev/ref/examples/component-actions/)
- [ ] Start to monitor for the application reaching out to the internet For example [Sonarqube](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/uds-package-sonarqube/tree/main/src/monitoring-image) tries to download a jar file from Maven central to enable monitoring with Prometheus (it is not baked into their images) - this custom image takes a Chainguard busybox base, adds the correct jar file, and creates a simple script that calls itself "curl" that doesn't curl and instead copies the Jar file it already has to make that piece work in the Air Gap. Its basically a shim around the way the upstream chart works.

#### Checkout
Your repository has a `zarf.yaml`, you can build a single artifact with `uds zarf package create`, and deploy it to a [k3d-core-dev-slim cluster](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/uds-core?tab=readme-ov-file#uds-package-development) using `uds zarf package deploy`

### Step 2 - UDS Package

Your goal is to integrate the Zarf package application with [UDS Core](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/uds-core), using `uds-package.yaml` custom resource.

- [ ] If you haven't already, read the docs on [UDS Operator](https://uds.defenseunicorns.com/core/configuration/uds-operator/)

- [ ] [UDS Package Practices](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/uds-common/blob/main/docs/uds-package-practices.md) provides an extensive list of best practices, considerations, and tasks for a package to be "Made for UDS"

#### Checkout
Your repository has a `uds-package.yaml` manifest added to the appropriate helm chart and you can deploy to a K3d Core Dev Slim cluster, via zarf package.

## Examples

For reference, consider these well-maintained UDS package examples:

- [UDS Package Mattermost](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/uds-package-mattermost) (Simpler example)
- [UDS Common NGINX](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/uds-common)
