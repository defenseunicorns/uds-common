[Oscal](https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/) is a set of standards for describing security and privacy controls for information systems. It is developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and is intended to be used by organizations to automate the exchange of security and privacy control information.

UDS Packages will include an `oscal-component.yaml` file that describes the security and privacy controls that the package implements. This file will likely be used by UDS Core to generate the OSCAL System Security Plan (SSP) for the package.
