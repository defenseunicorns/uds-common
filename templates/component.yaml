                ASSESSMENT-OBJECTIVE:
                AU-12a. audit record generation capability for the event types the system is capable of auditing (defined in AU-02_ODP[01]) is provided by [Assignment: organization-defined system components];
                AU-12b.  [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] is/are allowed to select the event types that are to be logged by specific components of the system;
                AU-12c. audit records for the event types defined in AU-02_ODP[02] that include the audit record content defined in AU-03 are generated.

                ASSESSMENT-OBJECTIVE:
                AU-02a.  [Assignment: organization-defined event types] that the system is capable of logging are identified in support of the audit logging function;
                AU-02b. the event logging function is coordinated with other organizational entities requiring audit-related information to guide and inform the selection criteria for events to be logged;
                AU-02c.
                	AU-02c.[01]  [Assignment: organization-defined event types (subset of AU-02_ODP[01])] are specified for logging within the system;
                	AU-02c.[02] the specified event types are logged within the system [Assignment: organization-defined frequency or situation];
                AU-02d. a rationale is provided for why the event types selected for logging are deemed to be adequate to support after-the-fact investigations of incidents;
                AU-02e. the event types selected for logging are reviewed and updated [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].

                ASSESSMENT-OBJECTIVE:
                AU-03a. audit records contain information that establishes what type of event occurred;
                AU-03b. audit records contain information that establishes when the event occurred;
                AU-03c. audit records contain information that establishes where the event occurred;
                AU-03d. audit records contain information that establishes the source of the event;
                AU-03e. audit records contain information that establishes the outcome of the event;
                AU-03f. audit records contain information that establishes the identity of any individuals, subjects, or objects/entities associated with the event.

              remarks: |-
                ASSESSMENT-OBJECTIVE:
                generated audit records contain the following [Assignment: organization-defined additional information].

                ASSESSMENT-OBJECTIVE:
                AU-08a. internal system clocks are used to generate timestamps for audit records;
                AU-08b. timestamps are recorded for audit records that meet [Assignment: organization-defined granularity of time measurement] and that use Coordinated Universal Time, have a fixed local time offset from Coordinated Universal Time, or include the local time offset as part of the timestamp.

                ASSESSMENT-OBJECTIVE:
                SC-13a.  [Assignment: organization-defined cryptographic uses] are identified;
                SC-13b.  [Assignment: organization-defined types of cryptography] for each specified cryptographic use (defined in SC-13_ODP[01]) are implemented.
